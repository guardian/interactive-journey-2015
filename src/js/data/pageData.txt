At around noon on Monday 20 April 2015, in the middle of the Mediterranean sea, a man on a boat puts a phone to his ear and listens to the dialling tone. It’s about the only sound he can hear. The boat’s engine has stopped, and though there are hundreds of other people huddling on the deck beside him, they are mostly straining to hear what he is about to say.
The dialling tone ends. A woman picks up, an activist based in Sicily, and the Syrian begins to talk. “We’re in the middle of the Mediterranean,” he blurts out. “We’re about 600 people – 200 women, 100 children. We’ve been without water for three days.”
The activist keeps calm. Nawal Soufi has become a point of contact for Syrians trying to get to Italy by boat, and she takes several of these calls a week. Once migrant boats approach Italian waters, its passengers often call Soufi, and she then calls the coastguards.

The Syrian continues: “The captain that was with us left us and ran away.”
It’s a small lie, designed to help the crew escape punishment if and when the boat is rescued. But now is not the moment to quibble. On the day these refugees left Egypt, 400 fellow migrants drowned south of Italy. Yesterday, 800 more people died in what was the Mediterranean’s most deadly modern-day shipwreck. There is a real risk that this boat will be the next to sink.
“For the love of god,” says the Syrian. “There are women and children on the boat, we don’t know what to do with them.”
Soufi begins to take charge. “You’re going to really concentrate on what I’m saying,” she says. She tells him to forget the coordinates the crew have told him to give her – they’re often wrong. Instead Soufi asks him to look inside the phone’s settings, once they’ve ended the call, and then to text her the GPS location it gives. Once she’s got that, she can call the coastguards.
“I want from you one thing,” she says. “I want you to make sure that everyone on the boat wears a lifejacket now, and whoever doesn’t have one should open up someone else’s lifejacket and fit two people inside. Don’t think that the sea is safe and that there’s no problem. Drowning can happen at any moment, even when the boat is being rescued.”
For the hundreds crowding the deck, this is one of the defining moments of their lives. They left Egypt five days ago, but their journeys began far further afield. There are families from Africa here, others from across the Middle East. Palestinians, Sudanese, Somalians – and Syrians, like the man holding a satellite phone in the middle of the deck. Some of them have been on the move for years, and now they are finally within striking distance of Italy. This phone-call is the moment they discover whether it was all worth it.

For one man, quietly sitting a few metres away from the man on the sat-phone, it is a particularly poignant step, the culmination of a three-year odyssey. A bulky 40-year-old with a gentle smile, whose greying hair make him seem older than he is, that man is Hashem Alsouki. A Syrian who first left his home in Damascus in April 2012, all that remains of Hashem’s house is the key in his pocket. The rest was blown up by the Syrian army when they tried to create a buffer-zone around Damascus airport.
For three years Hashem’s been on the move. His journey began when he was seized from his front-room and tortured for several months in 2012. On his release, he fled from village to village in Syria, but the war kept following him and his family. Finally enough was enough, and in 2013 they left via Jordan to Egypt. When they arrived it was a country that welcomed Syrians. But a week later, the government was ousted, the mood turned, and Egypt became a kind of purgatory for those fleeing the hell of the Syrian civil war. No jobs, little state recognition, and restricted access to government schools and hospitals. Just buckets of xenophobia.
So a year later, in 2013, Hashem and his family tried to flee their fifth home in 20 months. The boat was the only way. It was September, and they got as far as the beach, but they were arrested as they approached the water. Hashem, his wife Hayam, and their three boys: Osama, Mohamed, and Milad – the whole family then spent eight days in an Egyptian police station. In a strange way, it was a blessing in disguise: the ship they were due to take later sank. Around 500 drowned.
Seven months on, sitting on the deck, Hashem thinks of his children. He didn’t take them this year, not after last year’s disaster. But he’s risking this journey for them, so they don’t have to. So that they and their mum, Hayam, can be legally reunited with him if he reaches the other side – and if he later reaches Sweden.
Forty years old and his country destroyed, Hashem’s reckons his hopes and dreams are over. But his children’s are still worth dying for. “I’m risking my life for something bigger, for ambitions bigger than this,” he tells a pair of confidantes shortly before he leaves. “If I fail, I fail alone. But by risking this, I might achieve a dream for three children: my children – and maybe my grandchildren as well.”
He thinks especially of Osama, the oldest. The day Hashem left Egypt, 15 April 2015, was Osama’s birthday. And early that morning, Osama’s fourteenth year began with his father crying, apologising for his imminent departure, and then leaving in the knowledge that the pair might never speak again.
“I’m going to disappear for a long time, maybe forever,” Hashem explains in his diary later that night, as the boat chugs westwards towards Italy. “There is no safety at sea.”

headline: Chapter Two – The Odyssey Begins
standfirst: 6pm – Sunday, 15 April 2012

block: copy
copy:
Three years ago to the day, Hashem’s journey begins. It’s 15 April 2012, and again it’s Osama’s birthday. And again, it is a birthday interrupted.
Sunday’s a working day in Syria, the first of the working week, and Hashem gets home around 6pm. He sits down briefly with his boys to watch some television. Hayam, a teacher, is already cooking dinner in the kitchen, and Hashem is procrastinating before popping out to collect a cake for Osama.
And then there’s a knock at the door. More of a hammering, really – a hammering that Hashem never quite expected to come. He isn’t particularly political. He’s just a 37-year-old civil servant at the regional water board. He runs the computer department, and it’s his job to print the bills every month for the residents of Damascus and the surrounding countryside. He focusses on the water business, and minds his own.
But today, all that won’t matter. The regime is going from house to house, rounding up all the men they find. Whether it’s because they’re Sunni, living in a country run by Alawites, an offshoot of the Shia, Hashem can only speculate.
Hashem’s children watch him as he goes to open the door. Outside stand 20 men. Whether they’re from the army, the police, or a pro-regime militia, he doesn’t really know. But they’re for him, and half the people on his street.
Till now, the war has largely avoided Haran al-Awamid, a place of around 15,000 a few miles south-east of Damascus. It’s a quiet town with a lot of government employees. But in recent days, tensions have been raised. The regime killed two young men, tied their corpses to a car, and dragged them around town. Not everyone dared to react, but the pair’s friends and family did – they protested and chanted in the street.
And now, as Hashem is shoved into the back of a van, his children watching from their front-room, the regime is getting its revenge. It’s a long revenge, too. First Hashem and his neighbours are taken to a secret network of cells, dug deep beneath the nearby Damascus airport. They’re run by the powerful air-force intelligence, whose tentacles spread far beyond both aviation, and civilian oversight. No prosecutor asks after Hashem’s whereabouts, and neither he nor the others are charged or even interrogated. They’re simply beaten, and kept locked up until enough men have been rounded up from the surrounding villages. Three days later, they’re moved on – to the headquarters of aviation intelligence in Damascus itself.

Here, hundreds of men are crammed into single cells, deep underground. Every day, four or five of them are dragged to torture rooms. Single men are electrocuted with shocks to their genitals. Husbands like Hashem are sometimes spared that humiliation, but instead are hung from their wrists. Hashem spends 12 hours like this, the cords cutting into his skin. Others spend even longer and their hands later have to be amputated.
After about three months, he’s moved to some kind of airport hangar. For now, he doesn’t know where it is, though it later turns out to be Mazzeh airport, a military base used by the Assad family. The hangar is a vast space, capable of fitting a few planes. But there are so many prisoners crammed in here that they have to take it in turns to lie down.
It isn’t clear who rests by night, and who by day. They were robbed of their watches when they were first arrested. There is no natural light in this echoing space, so time’s passage can’t be measured. Months pass. Maybe seasons, but who knows. Ramadan comes and goes, but the prisoners are none the wiser. All that’s clear is that the beatings have decreased, as the guards grow bored of their violence. But no one asks when they’ll be released. They learn not to, for fear of one last hiding.
But one day, an officer comes to tell them that the president has decreed their release. The prisoners are driven in vans to the centre of Damascus, where they’re tossed out into the street. It turns out to be Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s main religious festivals, though at the time the prisoners know neither this, nor what has happened outside for the past half-year. They emerge blinking into the bright sunlight wondering what kind of Syria awaits them.
For Hashem, the future is immediately bleak. When Hashem was first arrested, the rebellion against the regime was only a year old, and violence had mostly left Haran al-Awamid untouched. But now as a friend drives him home, he notices that they’re going by an odd, circuitous route. What are we trying to avoid, Hashem asks. The frontline, his friend replies. When he gets home, the news gets worse. While he was away, two of Hayam’s brothers were shot by the same sniper on the same day. The second was trying to retrieve the corpse of the first.
A month later, the situation in Hashem’s town is untenable. Seeking safety, Hashem and Hayam move their three boys on. First to Hozroma, a nearby village due east of Damascus. But when the bombs start dropping metres from his sons as they return from school one afternoon, it’s clear that Hozroma is also no place to find sanctuary. Within days, they up sticks again to a village called Tal, on the other side of Damascus.
All around them, their country is collapsing – and so, too, is their home. Literally so. Back in Haran al-Awamid, the regime wants to create a buffer-zone around the nearby Damascus airport. So in February 2013, they destroy Hashem’s house, among hundreds of others. To this day, Hashem still carries the key. But the door it once unlocked is gone.
With their home turned to rubble, Syria looks less and less like a place in which Hashem’s family can eke out an existence. They struggle on in Tal, before moving in May to Damascus itself. But that month they decide enough is enough: Syria can no longer be home.
Within days, they apply for passports to leave Syria. In the short term, it’s a disastrous decision. At the passport office, standing in front of his children, Hashem is again arrested and dragged to prison. Here he finds children and old men, some who have languished in these cells for months. Hashem might have joined them. But after his colleagues vouch for his character, he’s free again a few days later, and allowed to re-apply for a passport, which is granted.
It’s an almost inexplicable moment of fortune, but Hashem has no time to count his blessings. He needs to leave. But where to? They think about Jordan, but they hear the conditions in the camps there are awful. Lebanon’s another option, and now home to a million fellow Syrians, but they fear a backlash from local Shia. There’s another option, though: Egypt. At the time, in June 2013, the Egyptian government welcomes Syrians.
So Egypt it is – if they can find the money. With no home to sell, they lack savings to pay for a plane. Hayam sells her jewellery, everything but her wedding ring, but they still can’t afford the airfare. But a bus to Jordan is within reach, and so is an onwards ferry to Egypt. Around 11,000 Syrian pounds will take them in a Pullman coach to the Jordanian port of Aqaba. The boat from there to Egypt is about $65.
So at around midday on 26 June 2013, the family turn up to Marjeh Square in central Damascus. It is brimming with Syrians on the move. There are plenty of tourism companies in the area, and before the uprising they catered for holiday-makers. Today their clients, hundreds of them piling onto a line of buses, are all escaping a war.
Every seat on Hashem’s family’s bus is taken, and their drive to Jordan is like a cross-section of the war they’re fleeing. They pass through Deraa, the city where the uprising began, and which was still being contested. They pass through regime checkpoints, where the soldiers curse and mock them. “Why are you abandoning the nation?” they’re asked. Then it’s the rebel checkpoints, and the response is the same disdain: “You’re leaving the country!” Only the extremists of Jabhat al-Nusra have a different line. “You’re abandoning jihad,” they shout. “You don’t want to be mujahadeen.”
Every checkpoint is an ordeal. At each one, each passenger has to haul his luggage from the bus, and present it for inspection. The process takes hours. The worst is at the last checkpoint: Nasib, on the border with Jordan. It’s 3am by the time they arrive, and the border officials want to check their details. But the computer system is down, and they must wait on the bus till it reboots.
The sun rises, and six hours later so does the computer. Mid-morning, they cross finally into Jordan. By the evening they’re in the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea. Their ferry leaves at midnight, and at around 4am on 27 June they arrive in the harbour of Nuweiba, a little town in Egypt’s Sinai peninsular. The boys are so tired that they sleep on the pavement.

In the darkness far out to sea, Hashem can’t see his neighbours but he can hear them scream. It’s partly his fault. They are two African women – perhaps from Somalia, but now is not the time to ask – and Hashem is spread-eagled on top of them. His limbs dig into theirs. They want to him to move, fast, and so would he. But he can’t – several people are sprawled on top of him, and there’s possibly another layer above them.
Dozens are crammed into this wooden dinghy. If anyone tries to shift, a smuggler kicks them back into place. They don’t want the crammed boat to overbalance, and then sink.
It is perhaps 11 at night, but Hashem can’t be certain. He’s losing track of time, and of place. Earlier in the evening, on a beach at the northern-most tip of Egypt, he and his companions were herded into this little boat. Now that boat is who-knows-where, bobbing along in the pitch darkness, lurching in the waves, somewhere in the south-eastern Mediterranean. And its passengers are screaming.
Some of the screams are in Arabic, some not. There are people from across Africa here, others from across the Middle East. There are Palestinians, Sudanese and Somalians. And Syrians, like Hashem. They want to get to northern Europe: Sweden, Germany, or anywhere they can start a second life after the collapse of their countries at home. For that distant hope they are risking this boat-trip to the Italian coast. All being well, they should reach Italy in five or six days. But for now, Hashem doesn’t know if he’ll survive the night. Or if anyone will.
An hour passes. They reach a second boat, a bigger one, and then a third, bigger still. At each new vessel, the smugglers toss them over the side like bags of potatoes. Now they have a bit more space, but they’re soaked. They had to wade through the waves to get to the dinghy, and the second boat was full of water. Their clothes drenched, they shiver. And they wretch.
The person squeezed to his left pukes all over Hashem. Then Hashem pays the favour forward, spewing all over the person to his right. He looks up, and realises everyone’s at it, everyone’s clothes are caked in other people’s vomit. Each has paid more than $2000 to spew over fellow refugees. “It’s a vomiting party,” Hashem thinks to himself.
When he first arrived in Egypt, Hashem didn’t imagine he’d leave by boat. Egypt was supposed to be safe for Syrians – and at least when he first entered it, in late June 2013, it was. Syrians could easily access state schools and hospitals. The government was laissez-faire about their paperwork. Many were there illegally, but no official paid any attention.
But within days of Hashem’s arrival, all that stopped. On 3 July 2013, Egypt’s first freely-elected president, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi, was ousted by the army, after a week of mass-protests against his rule. The state’s attitude to Syrians changed overnight.
The borders closed to Syrians without prior visas. Those without proper paperwork – and there were many – began to be arrested at checkpoints. Officials and their mouthpieces in the media began to claim that Syrians were terrorists, or supporters of Morsi. As the jihadist threat in Syria itself began to rise, Syrians in far-away Egypt were being tarred with the same brush.
One TV host, Youssef el-Husseini, told Syrians: “If you interfere in Egypt, you will beaten by 30 shoes.” Another, Tawfik Okasha, told Egyptians to arrest any Syrians they found in public. Having left one civil war, Hashem and his family found themselves in a country that sometimes seemed to be on the brink of another.
After arriving in Sinai, they spent their remaining savings on a series of taxis to a newly-built town in the desert to the east of Cairo, 10 Ramadan City. The name referenced a victorious Egyptian offensive at the start of the 1973 war with Israel. But there was little triumphant about their first few months there. With no money to pay rent, his family lived for four months in the storeroom of a tiny sewing sweatshop. Even when they finally moved out, it was only to a cramped flat without furniture. They couldn’t afford any. Visitors would sit on the floor to drink tea with them.
Hayam couldn’t find work as a teacher in 10 Ramadan City, and there were no computing jobs for Hashem. So he joined a food company in the next town, wrapping vegetables, and later moved to a charcoal factory. He earnt about $100 dollars a month.
It was a pretty dismal experience. After the rise of Islamic State, the owner of the local supermarket started to berate Hashem – as if the rise of the extremist group was all his fault. “You’re bringing Daesh here, you’re from the Muslim Brotherhood,” he shouted, referencing both the local nickname for Isis, and then Morsi’s political movement. “Go back to your own country.”
Then, in the summer of 2014, came a stroke of luck. A friend in Germany offered to put the money up for the family to go by boat to Europe – around $7,000 for the five of them. A smuggler was called. Their numbers are easy to come by in the Syrian community, and Hashem was put in touch with the lieutenants of one called Fouad al-Jamal, a Palestinian-Syrian nicknamed Abu Hamada. A former engineer in his early 60s, Abu Hamada now makes millions as the kingpin of a key Egyptian people-smuggling network. A deal with Abu Hamada’s men was struck, and on 20 August Hashem’s family arrived by arrangement in Alexandria, Egypt’s main Mediterranean port.

The centre of Alex, as it’s nicknamed, is one of fading fin-de-siecle grandeur – villas and ruins, crowding an ancient harbour. But its poorer residents mostly live in the high-rise suburbs at its perimeter: forests of tower-blocks, euphemistically called names like Miami and Palm Beach. They bare little resemblance to their namesakes. Hashem, Hayam, Osama, Mohamed and Milad came to Miami, where Abu Hamada’s men hustled them and hundreds of others into a set of gloomy flats, block-booked for the summer.
Then they waited their turn. After five days’ delay, the smugglers came again for them. And so began the daily grind of trying to get aboard boats. In the late afternoon, hundreds of them were picked up by four or five curtained coaches and driven westwards in search of the designated departure point. Masked smugglers drove cars in front and behind the convoy, and the drive went on for hours. But as they neared the beach, the smugglers suddenly said the weather was too bad. The trip was cancelled, so back they went back to Alex, where they were taken to new flats in another area.
This abortive routine went on for days on end. The drop-off would sometimes be cancelled because of alleged police presence. Other times, it was bad weather – and, on one occasion, even a brief kidnap by Bedouins. Sometimes, one or two coaches would get delivered to the beach – typically the coaches that carried people who’d bribed the smugglers for special treatment. The rest would be taken back to Alex, and usually were simply kept on the coaches until the next attempt – an exhausting and destabilising experience. Some would be sometimes delivered or left to the police.
Saturday 6 September 2014 was the day the family finally reached a beach, more than a fortnight after arriving in Alexandria. This time it was a beach far to the east of Alex, near a town called Gamasa. As the family emerged onto the sands, dozens of refugees were already wading through the waves to reach two dinghies bobbing several metres from the shore. The Alsoukis waited their turn.
But their turn never came. Instead came the shout: “Police, police.” Within moments, uniformed men appeared on the beach, firing weapons. Some made a run for it. Hashem’s family stayed put, and they spent the next eight days in a police jail. There was just one silver lining: the boat they would have taken later sank, killing its 500 passengers. It was, Hashem would later say, “one whole month of unfortunate events.”
And yet here he is again, not eight months later, trying the whole saga again. “If you were a refugee, living here, you would try again 10 more times,” he says. He wears a lifejacket, a gift from a friend. There’s a small black bag on his back, containing just the essentials. A wheel of President’s cheese. A blue jumper. A notebook. His identity papers, and a Human Rights Watch report about the destruction of Haran al-Awamid, hang from his neck in a waterproof pouch.
It’s just him this time. He didn’t dare put his family through the same trauma a second year running. But sod’s law means this year is easier than last. It’s the same gang, but this time their methods are simpler. Hashem and his fellow travellers are driven all the way from Cairo to Gamasa. No flats this year. No Groundhog Days along the north coast. First time lucky, they get to the beach – the same beach as last year, incidentally – and first time lucky they get to the dinghies.
But within an hour, Hashem’s wondering if it was all worth it. He’s sitting on the deck of the third boat, the boat that’s supposed to take them to Italy, and he’s covered in vomit. The boat is swaying, and his world is spinning. Hundreds of people are being loaded, tossed really, onto the ship. It takes hours – long, cold hours. Everyone is nauseous. Everyone is shivering. In front of him, children are turning blue.
Dawn breaks, at last. With it comes warmth, and with the warmth their clothes begin to dry. People look at each other properly for the first time. They share out sea-sickness pills and lemons, both meant to ward off nausea. The crew come round with the daily meal – a slip of brown bread for each traveller, and a sliver of processed pate. But afternoon arrives, and everyone is still hungry. Hashem gets out his President’s cheese, meant to last him the whole week, and gives it all to the children around him. People smile, and begin to talk. They’re on their way.
But first, as the sun begins to dip, there’s yet another change of boats. The smugglers know they’ll lose the ship that arrives in Italy, so they want to use a ship that they can afford to lose – something that’s a bit older, a bit slower. No passenger is happy about it, but there’s no point complaining. Last year’s shipwreck, the one that Hashem narrowly avoided, reportedly happened after the migrants refused to move ships. The smugglers then rammed two boats together, to try to force the passengers of one to board the other. The first boat capsized.
Hashem makes the most of the move, and on the new boat finds a place next to the engine room. At least there it’ll be warm. Others aren’t so lucky: the Africans are mostly shoved downstairs. If this boat capsizes, they’ll be the first to drown.
Night falls, and Hashem tries to sleep. It’s hard on the boat. There’s no space to lie down, so people sleep while sitting, hunched over their laps – or they take it in turns to stretch out on their back. But for everyone, whatever physical contortion they find themselves in, sleep is often hard to come by. The wails of nearby babies make it elusive.
Friday comes and goes, and people settle into the rhythm of the boat. For the first time, there are queues for the bathroom. There are conversations, and the first hints of friendships. Hashem meets Emad, another Syrian who fled Damascus. He tried to open a shop in Egypt, but it failed. So here he is, on the way to Europe instead.
Saturday morning, their third on the boat, is the brightest, hottest yet. It’s a morning of good omens. The sun is so warm that the passengers take off their winter clothes. They gaze out to sea. And then in the waters in the middle-distance, they see something glistening in the sunlight. Whatever it is, there’s more than one of it. The excitement draws a crowd to the side of the boat. People squint, and then cheer. There, leaping in waves, are four dolphins.
The crew hustle people back to their places – they don’t want the boat to overbalance. But people are smiling now. It’s given them something in inspire them. Hashem strikes up a conversation with Walid, a 12-year-old from Eritrea, one of the world’s worst dictatorships. Walid wants to train to be a pilot in Europe, and something about that dream strikes a chord with Hashem.
“Walid reminds me of my kids,” Hashem writes in his diary. “I miss them and their dreams.”
All around him, the mood of the boat is upbeat. The crew seems to think they’ll get to Italy soon. A Syrian, the same man who later calls the Sicilian activist, is asked by the sailors to shout out a set of instructions. When the coastguards arrive, he says, everyone must remain calm, and they shouldn’t rat on the crew. Everyone’s thoughts turn to Europe, the promised land.
But Hashem feels conflicted. He’s still thinking about his wife, and his kids, and he knows a long road lies ahead. “Everyone is happy but I have mixed feelings,” he writes, as the sun begins to set. “I long for my family – I’ll be away from them for a year. But some things give me comfort, most importantly the fact that I’ll be achieving the dreams of my children.” If he can just get to Sweden, he can apply for them to join him. If he can get to Sweden, they’ll have a future.
It’s a beautiful sunset, he tells his diary: “just us, the sea, the sun, and nothing else.” Hashem gets out his phone to capture the scene. But as he looks at the sun through the screen he notices something odd. Aren’t they heading west? And doesn’t the sun set in the west? And if so, why is boat heading towards it?
Hashem raises it with his neighbours. Look at the sun, he says. Are we heading back to Egypt?
People begin to nod, and the news spreads throughout the ship. Suddenly there’s uproar. They’ve come too far to turn back, and they’re furious. The captain emerges from the bridge. Tough, he says: his bosses want to cram 30 more people onboard. Thirty more? “Yes,” says the captain. “They’re worth $60,000.”
It’s bad news, exhausting news – but it’s not as bad as they first thought. The extra 30 are already on their way in another boat, and in the end they meet halfway, in international waters. The new arrivals bring new supplies – cigarettes for the adults, diapers for the babies. Tempers calm, and people drift off to sleep.
Sunday arrives. More and more, the talk turns to the future, to Europe. One Syrian woman hopes it’ll mark the end of 50 years of migration. As a child, she fled the Golan Heights after the Israeli occupation in 1967. “Today I’m emigrating with my daughters to Europe, and god knows if my grandchildren will emigrate too,” she tells her new friends. “I hope that won’t happen, our whole life is migration after migration.”
Where Hashem sits, an area of exposed decking at the back of the boat, a real camaraderie has been built. “The ship looks like a complete community, with families and individuals, young and old, white and black,” he writes that day. “It’s a small mixed community where everyone cooperates with everyone else.”
Another night passes, and at dawn on Monday, the crew again promises that they’re nearly in Italian waters. Again, they’re told how to act once the coastguards arrive. Stay calm, don’t identify the smugglers, don’t move about in the boat. Around noon, the captain switches the engine off. The passengers stop talking. The Syrian with the loudest voice is handed a satellite phone. There’s a number he has to ring to reach an activist in Sicily. She’ll call the coastguards once she finds out where they are.
The dialling tone starts. Nawal Soufi picks up. This, everyone knows, is it. “We’re in the middle of the Mediterranean,” the Syrian says. “We’re about 600 people – 200 women, 100 children. We’ve been without water for three days.”
Job done, the whole boat sits and waits. An hour, maybe two. The crew leave the bridge and scatter themselves among the passengers. Here we go, thinks Hashem: the trip is over.
And so everyone thinks – until an aircraft flies low overhead, taking pictures as it goes. The captain looks up. That’s a Greek reconnaissance plane, he says, not an Italian one.
People turn their heads. A Greek plane? Are they still in Greek waters? It’s another cruel setback. Greek waters mean Greek coastguards and a Greek rescue mission, and no one wants to go to Greece. Greece would be a disaster. Greece means walking through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary – three countries that lie outside the EU – to reach Germany.
The passengers begin to shout. They paid for Italy, not for Greece, and they want the engines re-started. Nothing doing, says the captain. The coastguards have been called, and the die is cast. But no one will stand for it, and eventually he backs down. The captain fires up the engines, and the boat moves faster than ever towards Italy.
Night falls, and the mood is fraught. The sea is rough, probably too rough for the speed they are cruising at. But no one wants to slow down, in case the Greek coastguard catches them before they’re within Italian jurisdiction. So they plough on – until suddenly the engine judders to a halt. A tense two hours follow, as the crew attempt to fix things while there’s still time.
With no momentum of its own, the boat rocks in the heaving waves. People scream, and for the first time since the first night they genuinely fear being drowned. Hashem himself is almost too exhausted to notice. He’s been standing on one leg for hours, to give other people more room to sleep. Eventually, the engine gets going again, and at four in the morning another passenger allows Hashem to sleep in his place. He collapses, shattered, into a deep sleep.
He’s shaken awake the next day to the news he’s waited for all week: the Italians have arrived. He blinks, and peers over the side. Sure enough, four huge red inflatable boats are circling their ship. Each has a white cabin painted with the words: “Guardia Costiera”. He smiles. They’re still a day from Italy, but they’re almost there. It’s over. The journey is over.
Two of the Italian boats draw alongside, and they begin to transfer people to a larger steel-hulled ship. It’s women and children and first, and the process takes a couple of hours, but no one minds. The atmosphere is joyous. People clap and chant with gratitude. “Italia!” they cheer. “Italia, Italia, Italia!”

A kilometre inside the French border, Hashem Alsouki wonders whether he can leave the toilet yet. He went there to escape the police, but that was ten minutes ago. Have they left yet? And if not, will they bother to check this bathroom?
Hashem hasn’t planned for this. The hard bit of the journey was supposed to be the boat, not the onwards odyssey through Europe. But five days after getting off the ship, he now finds himself having to overcome yet more hurdles that he hadn’t really thought about until he arrived in Italy. Train timetables. Border crossings. Policemen.
Right now, the police are the most pressing concern. A group of French gendarmes entered this train at Menton, the first station inside France. They’re looking for people like Hashem – refugees trying to leave Italy. As he ducks into the toilet, just in time, they arrest two Eritreans in the same carriage. They’d been sitting only a few seats away. They’ll be sent back to Milan, where they’ll be fingerprinted by the police there – a formal process that means they’ll have to claim asylum in Italy.
And that is exactly what Hashem wants to avoid. Now he’s in Europe, he can claim asylum anywhere. He’s supposed to do it in Italy, the first European country he came to. But if he does so, it might be a long time before he sees his wife and children again. The process of applying for family reunification in Italy is seen as comparatively slow – and France is no faster. So the goal is to get to at least Germany, where the process is considered more streamlined – or, even better, to Sweden, where Syrians are allowed indefinite leave to remain. And for Hashem that’s the ultimate prize: a long-term future in a place where his kids can settle without fear of having, yet again, to move on.
But first, he has to make it through France. And at the moment, with the French policemen pacing the corridor outside, he might not even get there in the first place. He waits it out. That’s all he needs to do: wait till they leave. He waits. He thinks. He reasons with himself. They won’t check everyone – just the people who look out of place. Eventually they’ll get bored and leave. Won’t they?
Hashem begins to panic. Maybe this wasn’t the best way to come. At first, he’d wanted to take the train directly from Milan to Munich – the quickest way to Germany. But others had warned him that he risked arrest by Austrian police once the train crossed into Austria. On the other hand, they said, the slow train to Nice in the south of France doesn’t get checked by police. How wrong had they been.
Minutes pass. The train doesn’t move. Surely the police are in another carriage by now? They must have left, Hashem decides. It’s been too long. So he thumbs the lock, takes a deep breath, opens the door, and leaves the toilet. It’s yet another make-or-break moment, the kind that could decide not just his life, but that of his wife and their children.
He re-enters his carriage. He looks up. There, blocking the aisle ahead of him, is a French policeman.
Five days earlier, he’d been so glad to see the authorities. The Italian frigate took about a day to reach Catania, a port in Sicily, and throughout the journey the migrants couldn’t stop thanking their rescuers. People stayed up late, talking about their plans – who wanted to go to Sweden, who wanted to reach Germany. They finally arrived at the Sicilian coast on the morning of Wednesday 22 April.
The police got on before anyone got off. The officers picked their way through the crowds, and identified the Egyptian crew-members. It was as if they’d been tipped off: they knew them all by sight. Then they asked a few migrants themselves: are these the smugglers? To a man, they denied it. The smugglers left in a rubber dinghy before the boat was rescued, they claimed. But the police didn’t seem to buy it, and the Egyptians were escorted away.
Then the passengers started to disembark. First children, then women, then the men. Finally Hashem walks down the gangway and sets foot for the first time on Italian soil. It’s a feeling of immense relief. He thinks first of his family, so far away. If their future could be characterised as a sole pricked by thorns, then Hashem’s just plucked out the pointiest one.
He’s taken to a Red Cross tent, where doctors give him a medical check-up. Then he gives his name, and he’s photographed holding a number: 312. He’s handed a bottle of water, an apple, and a sandwich. And then a convoy of busses turn up, and they’re all piled inside.
No one knows where they’re going, but the assumption is a camp for asylum seekers. But night falls, and the bus keeps on driving. Someone asks the driver: where are we off to? Venice, he says.
Those with phones look up Venice on a map. Is it in Sicily? To their surprise, it’s not. It’s at the opposite end of the country. Everyone’s delighted. They all wanted to move northwards, and now the Italians are doing it for them.
Eighteen hours later, at lunchtime on Thursday, the buses arrive in the mainland part of Venice. The canals and gondolas will have to wait till another day: the migrants are taken straight to a police station where they give their personal details. Name, age, nationality. But that’s it. A policeman asks Hashem if he wants to be finger-printed. Under EU law, he’s not supposed to have the choice. An asylum-seeker is meant to be finger-printed in the first European country he reaches, so that he can’t move on elsewhere. But the Italians want migrants to stay in Italy as little as the migrants want to live there. So Hashem says no, the policeman smiles, and that’s that.
Outside, Hashem rejoins a small group of Syrian men he befriended on the boat. A volunteer takes them to a centre where they can wash and phone. He explains to them how they can get to Milan, the springboard for journeys to northern Europe. Using the man’s instructions, they make for a nearby station called Mestre, where they spend the night sleeping on the station benches. Early the next day they take the train onwards to Milan, arriving at its main terminus in the middle of the morning.
It’s quite a juxtaposition, Milan central station. The building was first begun early in the twentieth century, a vast, Romanoid palace that looms over the surrounding piazza. Inside its columns is a chic shopping mall, branches of Zara, Mango and Swarovski that spread over three malls. In the main concourse, old men in tailored suits sip on their espressos in the cafes, watching well-coiffed businessmen glide through the glass doors to the platforms.
Yet just down a set of stone steps, in the station’s echoing atrium, is another world. Here, on a stone mezzanine, Hashem joins hundreds of migrants who gather here daily to contemplate their next step. For months it’s a scene that’s been part of the station’s rhythm – so much so that local police have even cordoned off a bit of floorspace for migrants to permanently occupy. Surrounded by a blur of oblivious Italians, here are Syrians, Iraqis, Eritreans and Somalians – some of them still sunburnt from the sea. Every few hours there’s a new wave of arrivals, the latest boatload from Sicily. Some set out from Libya, some from Egypt. But they’re all mingling in this grand atrium in Milan.
Hashem looks around in a state of wonder. He’s surrounded by statues and friezes, ornate lamps and marble plaques. For a few minutes, the station feels like a beautiful castle, built for the migrants. There are volunteers from local charities, here to hand out water and food. There are people from the local authority, trying to find people beds for the night. It’s a far cry from the treatment many of these people experienced only days prior. Sitting on a marble bench, another Syrian recounts how he was essentially kept hostage for the past four months on the Libyan coast. Whereas here in Milan station, there’s even wifi. Hashem makes use of it, switching on his Whatsapp for the first time since Egypt. A wave of unread messages floods his inbox.
But a new continent, nevertheless, brings a new set of problems. How on earth is he going to wriggle through mainland Europe to Sweden? He hadn’t really contemplated it before. He’d assumed it would be straightforward.
But now there are complex choices to be made, borders to be navigated, police to be dodged. He needs money, but he hasn’t got enough. He needs to know the train lines, but he doesn’t understand them. In the concourse, he looks up at the departures board. It reads like hieroglyphics.
“The sea was easy!” Hashem smiles, only half-joking. “It was direct to Italy. No changes, no police, no stations. No fingerprints.”
The volunteers advise people to take a train to Verona, then another one to Germany, and then Scandinavia. But Hashem’s not sure. So he calls a friend of a friend – a Syrian called Mehyar who made the boat trip last year, and who’s now safely in Germany. How on earth did he do it?
Don’t go directly to Germany, Mehyar advises. The trains between Italy and Germany have to go via Switzerland and Austria, and the police in both countries often board the carriages. Instead, he should take a roundabout route along the coast to France, past the Piedmontese hills and onwards to Nice. That’s the way Mehyar went, and there were no police at the border.
But the decision can wait another day. First Hashem wants his first good night sleep in 10 days. He wants to wash, to feel clean. After 10 days in the same clothes, he doesn’t feel comfortable in his own skin. So he waits for the Milanese authorities to allocate him a place at one of their migrant camps. Families get taken first, so he’s the last priority. Day turns into night, and the station starts to lose its appeal. With nowhere to sleep, even this grand place is just another reminder of a migrant’s rough lot.
Eighteen hours since their last proper meal, the last few refugees turn increasingly delirious. One of them bangs his head against a hoarding. Another lashes out in frustration: “We have been treated like cattle wherever we went – in Libya, in Sicily, and now here.” Local volunteers doggedly stay with Hashem and the others – some of them will stay all night. But not everyone is so welcoming. A passer-by’s voice echoes around the hall: “Why you helping these immigrants? Aren’t there enough poor in this country already?”
Finally, at well past nine at night, the local officials return. There’s some space for them at a place a few miles away. They’re driven westwards in a minibus, to a suburb called Certosa where they’re billeted in a converted school. Their beds are among hundreds lined up in rows inside what used to be a green-floored basketball court.
On Saturday, he and his group muddle their way through the metro back to the station. It’s a short but confusing journey, and one that makes him question whether Europe’s infinitely more complex railway networks are best method of getting to Sweden. And there’s worse news waiting for him. Of the Syrians who tried to reach Germany yesterday, all but two of them were arrested – and they include people who tried to go through France. It’s a disaster, and Hashem loses all confidence in the railway as a route out of Italy.
The other option is the car. At the centre last night, people were sharing numbers for smugglers who, for a fee, will drive people north. It’s a safer option: no one stops cars at European borders, and you don’t have to constantly navigate a rail system you don’t understand. There are various different smugglers for hire. There’s someone in Malmo, Sweden, who says he can drive four people to Sweden for €875 each. For €750 someone else will drive you to Copenhagen. A third man offers a ride to Ulm in southern Germany. Some smugglers take a dozen people in vans; these chaps drive small cars.
But even this route has its problems. The chap in Malmo is just that – in Malmo. He wants half the money up front before he drives down to Italy. But what if he pockets the cash and stays put? It’s a lot of money – far more than the trains. The guy in Copenhagen hardly wants less, and he won’t take you all the way. And Ulm is only really useful if you want to end up in Germany. But Hashem doesn’t.
For now, though, this debate is academic: at the moment, Hashem has no money to pay for either route. He’s still waiting for his brother-in-law – Ehsan, a doctor in Sweden – to wire him something to tide him over. Around lunchtime, that payment is made, so Hashem queues up at the Western Union in the station to pick it up. In the queue are several familiar faces: he’s not the only refugee in need of a helping hand.
There are endless forms to fill in, and Hashem doesn’t understand half of what the man is saying behind the glass screen. Pikuthepen. What? Pickupthepen. What? PICK. UP. THE. PEN. He picks up the pen. He signs a bit of paper. The money is shoved underneath the glass. It comes to just over 500 euros.
Today’s the day he thought he’d be moving on. And now he can: with the money he now has in total, Hashem’s got just enough for a car to Denmark. But is that the best option? He hasn’t a clue by this point. He’s come so far, but with his next move he could still blow it all. Then the news comes through that, actually, no one got arrested on the French border yesterday – the guys were detained in Austria. So the railway suddenly becomes more palatable. And so instead of moving on today, he traipses back to the metro with his friends. There’s a train to Nice at seven the next morning. Tonight, he’ll make his mind up whether or not to take it.
In the end, he does. Both the car and the train seem to have their risks, but at least the train is cheaper. And his friends from the boat, the ones who were keenest about the car, are still dithering – whereas Hashem is keen to crack on. The sooner he reaches Sweden, the sooner he sees his family. So the 7am to Nice it is, along a railway line that hugs the coast as it heads west past the hills of Piedmont. He carries almost nothing – just the water-proof pouch with his money and a few key documents. His blue jumper, the one that kept him warm on the boat, he leaves in a bin.
The train flits in and out of tunnels to give him alternating glimpses of pastel-coloured streets, and steep wooded hillsides. Often, though, all he sees is the sea, and that sight floods him with dread. He just can’t get away from the Mediterranean. The best he can do is shift in his seat, and turn the other way. He wants a smoke to calm his nerves, but he knows in Europe you can’t do that on a train. It’ll be a recurring tension.
Everything goes wrong at Menton, the first station after the French border. That’s where Hashem finds himself, heart pounding, in the toilet. And that’s where he emerges prematurely to find a policeman still blocking the aisle next to his seat.
Hashem gulps. Is this it, then? He thinks about turning around, but that’ll make him a person of interest. Whereas if he strides forward with purpose, he might get away with it. The policeman isn’t checking everyone. And if you don’t look too hard at Hashem’s clothes, don’t notice the dandruff caking his collar, or the whiff of unwashed socks, perhaps, just perhaps, he could be a Frenchman.
At least that’s what Hashem hopes as he puts his head down and marches down the aisle. The gendarme looks up. Hashem nods at him. The policeman blinks. And then lets him pass.
So Hashem escapes this time, but the whole encounter gives him a scare. By the time the train draws into Nice at ten to noon, his mind is scrambled. If this is what it’s like at every border, then is there even any point in trying for Sweden? Maybe his best bet now is to just go to Calais, and try to break into a lorry bound for the UK. Maybe that’s as good a route as any.
To make matters worse, no train bound for Paris has a seat free for six hours. They’re all booked up. So Hashem has an afternoon to kill in a city that he fears might be the end of him. Buying new tickets is ordeal enough. He doesn’t understand the self-service machines, so he’s constantly cancelling his transaction and starting again. In the queue behind him, people tut, and shift noisily from one foot to the other. Can’t he get a move on?
He gets there eventually – by which time, he’s killed half an hour. But now what? Should he stay in the station? No, not while there’s so many other Syrians here. If he can spot them from 50 metres, so too can the police. But he can’t just go sit in a cafe either. He doesn’t want to spend any money. He tries strolling around, but a blister on his foot, which got infected during the sea-crossing, gives him hell. What about the beach? Not now – he’s sick of the sea. He tries a bench on a quiet street next to a grocer’s – but the grocer wants to talk. He moves on. Five hours to go.
The wait gnaws at him. Should he have gone by car? Could he go by car now? Or bus? Once in Paris, should he go via Belgium? Or stick to Germany? Hashem can’t think straight, and every time he sees a policeman he feels a rush of panic. He clicks his teeth. His nerves are shot.
He finds a small public garden next to a railway bridge. In one half of the enclosure, a group of men play boule. In the other, children run around playing boule. He sits here for a while, and again thinks of his own kids. “My children,” he mutters. “Where are *my* children?”
He sends his wife a message, telling her he’s in France. She’s confused – she thought he might be in Germany by now – and replies with a sad-faced emoticon. Three hours to go.
Hashem moves on. He thinks of buying a phone-card, one that’ll work across Europe. But he tries one shop, then a second, then a third – no one has something like that. He gives up. He finds a busier part of town, where all the tourists are. Here he gives in, and has a coffee at a cafe. An evening chill is setting in, and he shivers. He watches the trams bustle to and fro along the street before him, and for a moment he wishes he could board one. Tourists stroll past. It’s funny to see people here on holiday, for the beach and the sun, at a time when he’s fleeing for a safer life. Two hours to go.
He wanders into a church, and takes a pew halfway towards the altar. Somewhere to sit down again. At the sides of the church, under the stained-glass windows, people pay a few euros to light a candle. The place reminds him of a church in Syria – a monastery in Saidnaya that is perched on a craggy hilltop. Hashem’s a Muslim, but every once in a while, he would go to Saidnaya to light a candle and enjoy the view. How far away that all seems.
At 7pm, with an hour to go till the train to Paris, Hashem limps back to the station. Three soldiers amble around in circles near the station entrance, giving him pangs of panic. He’s destroyed all the sundry tickets and receipts he had from Italy, meaning that if he’s caught now, he won’t be sent back to Italy. But even so, France isn’t a place he wants to settle in. His family can’t join him here.
In the newsagent’s at the station, he gets a French newspaper, something to make him blend into a crowd. He plumps for Le Monde. By coincidence, its journalists have written about Hashem’s country today. Or rather they’ve translated work by Der Spiegel – a long report into the origins of Isis. On another page there’s a picture of Segolene Royal. She used to be the partner of the president, right? Hashem knows a bit about European politics.
Le Monde does the trick: the ticket inspector greets him in French on the platform. Hashem nods awkwardly, and hurries to his seat. He eases it back – on these French night trains, he notes with admiration, the leather seats almost fold flat – and tries to sleep. Soon the whole carriage is gently snoring. Some of them are backpackers who snooze with jackets placed over their faces, others are elderly tourists from Italy who’ve come prepared with eye-patches. But Hashem is the exception. The tension keeps him wide awake all night. All he can think of is the German border.
Hashem looks out the window, and he realises he still hasn’t parted ways with the sea. The sight of it sickens him, but he has to endure it while the train follows the coast round to Marseille – only then does it leave the coast. Finally it winds slowly up through France, going first from east to west, and then west to east, turning back on itself like the queue for an airport check-in desk. Every few minutes it stops at some new, half-lit platform. Or at least, that’s what it seems like to Hashem, who’s awake for every one, listening to the creak of the seats, and the occasional cough or sneeze from a stirring passenger. He needs a smoke, but he can’t while he’s on the train, and he’s too scared to hop off for a quick cigarette on a provincial platform.
Dawn finally comes, revealing flatter countryside just south of Paris. A short while later, nearly 12 hours after it left Nice, the train eventually arrives in the capital itself at twenty to eight on the morning of Monday 27 April. It’s the twelfth morning since Egypt. A short metro ride takes him from Gare Austerlitz to Gare de l’Est, and now he’s one train journey from Germany. In fact, he could be in Sweden by the early hours of tomorrow. In Paris he can buy tickets to Hamburg, via Frankfurt. From Hamburg, another series of trains will bring him to Copenhagen. And from Copenhagen, it’s just a half-hour hop across the Oresund Bridge to Sweden.
But first, he has an hour to kill in Gare de l’Est. It’s funny to be flitting through some of Europe’s finest cities, but to see them only through their stations. Gare de l’Est isn’t the biggest of them, but to Hashem it still feels vast – more of an airport than a station. “Who are all these people?” he wonders at the commuters, marching past him into the city. “They’re all going to work, these people?”
He goes to the ticket office to buy tickets to Hamburg. The price is over 250 euros. Hashem blinks – 250? Did he hear that right? That’s a third of what he might have paid to get from Milan to Copenhagen by car. But then he shrugs. He has no other choice.
Waiting for the train, Hashem shivers in the cold – partly because of the temperature, but also because he hasn’t slept or eaten since yesterday lunchtime. He goes to a little cafe beside the platforms. He looks at the sandwiches on display. Which of them are halal? That one? No, he realises. It’s got pork in it.
Just after nine, he boards the train to Frankfurt. Two hours twenty minutes to the border, and the anxiety rises in him once again. He doesn’t want to stop in Germany, but if he can at least get there, he’ll be reunited eventually with his family. And that’s what matters.
Hayam messages him. Where are you now? Hashem doesn’t answer – not yet. He doesn’t want to jinx it.
At 9:10am, the train to Frankfurt eases out of Paris. Europe’s railways never stop impressing him. This one has carriages with two floors, and huge seats that seem more like armchairs than anything Hashem’s used to on a train.
He goes for a shave while he still has time. He bought a little razor in Gare de l’Est – or rather, he bought a whole packet of them because he couldn’t find a single one for sale on its own. But the packet was worth it. If a policeman does get on in Saarbrucken, the first town in Germany, he knows that appearances matter.
A copy of Charlie Hebdo lies on the table. He picks it up. The cover cartoon shows something like Kate Winslet rising out of a boat of migrants. “Un Titanic par semaine,” it says. “A Titanic every week.” Hashem doesn’t quite get it. Who on earth is that woman? But he smiles, regardless. It’s about refugees like him.
At 11:30, the train scuds over the German border, and slows down as it approaches Saarbrucken. Another moment of reckoning awaits. Hashem busies himself with hiding in plain sight. He dusts off his dandruff, plugs in some headphones, and buries himself in a copy of Suddeutsche Zeitung that he bought in Paris. He can’t read a word of it, but he hopes no one will test him.
The train crosses a bridge over a river that cuts through a lush bit of greenery. It’s a pretty sight, and Hashem momentarily loses himself. “Manzar gameel,” he says loudly, over the top of the music blaring in his ears. “Lovely view.”
The whole carriage flinches. A few people turn and stare. And then the train stops in Saarbrucken.

Has he blown it? The train has come to a halt inside the German border, and with his sudden outburst, Hashem wonders if he’s just given the game away. What if the police get on, and someone rats on him? What if one of them is a policeman in the first place?
An old woman arrives, and asks someone to change their seat. Then a balding man with a straggly beard. So far, so normal. But what about the border guards? Are they on the platform? From this angle, peeking from behind the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Hashem can’t see.
A minute passes, then another. After an age, the train moves off. The women making the announcements on the tannoy switches to German first, French second. A sigh of relief: Hashem’s in Germany. He puts down the Suddeutsche Zeitung. Just two borders to go.
Saarbrucken gives way to Mannheim, and Mannheim eventually cedes to Frankfurt, where Hashem gets out. Finally he can smoke again. He leaves the station and lights one, two, three cigarettes. Across the road, Syria’s state airline has an office. Or rather, did have one. It’s shuttered shut now.
Hashem goes back inside, and waits on the platform for the train to Hamburg. A huge hoarding for Frankfurter Allgemeine looms overhead. His heart is pounding. The next few hours will decide the rest of his life. He needs another smoke, and discovers a small designated smoking area marked out on the platform with white paint. To a newcomer, it’s bizarre. If I cross this line, he thinks, it’s not allowed? But if I stay this side, it is? So what’s that woman doing smoking over there?
Three and a half hours later, Hashem’s in Hamburg, another beautiful city that he’ll only catch a glimpse of. With another hour to kill, he strolls in the streets surrounding the station, and marvels at its two gothic clock towers. He likes the order of things, how everyone waits at the traffic lights until it’s their turn. Now that Sweden seems within reach, Hashem’s appetite begins to return, and he buys a small slice of pizza for a couple of euros. He thinks about staying the night here: there are sometimes border checks in Denmark, and you’re more conspicuous if you travel at night. But that’s all academic – he has no one to stay with, and without a passport he can’t take a bed in a hostel.
So very soon he’s back at the self-service machine, thumbing at its unresponsive screen his tickets to Copenhagen. He’s getting better at this now. First there’ll be a train to Flensburg, the last town in Germany. Then another to Fredericia. Finally a third will sweep him from Jutland, the Danish mainland, to Copenhagen, which lies on the island of Zealand, just south of Sweden.
The train to Flensburg is the least comfortable of the five he’s used so far. He sits in the bike compartment, and has to shuffle along when a cyclist asks for more space to lock up her fold-up. The countryside is pancake-flat, perfect for the white windmills the train passes every other mile. Wind energy, Hashem thinks: a good concept. The conductor, a big tattooed man, stamps his ticket, no questions asked.
The sun is setting as he arrives in Flensburg. The 20:56 to Fredericia is waiting just across the platform, and the Danish border lies just a mile or so beyond it. Hashem gets onboard and finds the seat furthest from the door. The language on the tannoy changes from staccato German to blurred Danish.
Hashem hides behind his latest bit of camouflage: the pink cover of Danish rail’s on-train magazine, Ud & Se, a surprisingly interesting publication for a train company. And then Hashem waits. It shouldn’t be long till he knows his fate: in five minutes he’ll be in Padborg, the first station inside Denmark, and the penultimate border. What will await him there?
Something bad, he thinks at first. There, standing on the platform at Padborg, are two Danes wearing what look like uniforms. Hashem sinks into his seat and prepares for the worst. The two uniforms board his carriage. But then the train eases off again. If they were going to check his passport, wouldn’t they need to get off afterwards? He waits some more. He abandons the pink train magazine, and pretends to be asleep. One of the uniformed men approaches. The clink of his keys grows nearer and nearer, until finally he stops beside Hashem’s table. Hashem peeks at him, through the crack in his eyelids. It’s just the ticket inspector, replacing his colleague.
At 10:31pm, the train draws into Fredericia. It’s the furthest north Hashem’s ever been, and his shivers show it. It’s cold. He waits in the pristine Danish waiting room, Poul Henningsen lampshades hanging from the ceiling. He gets a copy of Politiken newspaper, his latest bit of camouflage. He can’t smoke in the waiting room, so he goes in and out, in and out, bouncing between his dual fixes of nicotine and warmth. At just past 11pm, the dance ends: the train to Copenhagen arrives, and soon he’s ploughing east to the capital.
Two and a half hours later, in the small hours of Tuesday morning, Hashem steps foot on the platform in the Danish capital. Thirteen days after leaving Egypt, six after arriving in Italy, he is just one half-hour train ride from the holy grail. But first he needs to buy a ticket.
That proves hard. The first booth he tries requires a credit card. Syrian refugees don’t carry many of those. The second, which takes cash, reveals a bigger problem: he’s now outside the Eurozone, and he hasn’t any Danish krona. And at 1:30am, there aren’t many bureau d’exchanges to help him out.
So Hashem limps around the airy red-bricked concourse, trying to find any shop that will first take some euros, and then give him change in krona. McDonald’s is the only option, but even as he enters it someone else is being told that no, McDonald’s will not take euros. Try the 7-11 down the road.
He leaves the station for the empty streets outside, and eventually finds the 7-11. It’s on a crossroads lit like a Hopper painting. Will they take euros? The man behind the counter says yes, but only 10-euro notes. But that’s not enough. The ticket to Sweden costs the equivalent of 18 or 19 euros, so Hashem needs to pay with a 20-euro note, and get the largest amount of change he can. The shop assistant gives in. Alright then.
Hashem lurches around for the cheapest thing in the shop. Eventually he finds the smallest pack of gum, and gets the change in krona.
He limps back towards the station’s gothic walls. The clock above the entrance reads 1:54am, so he has 18 minutes till the next train to southern Sweden. He puts the krona in the slot. It’s just enough for a ticket, so finally he can cross the Oresund. The screech that accompanies the printing of a one-way train ticket has never sounded so good. He takes the escalator down to the platform level. Hashem has one more train journey to go. One more border to cross.
It could not come soon enough. Hashem is exhausted – physically, mentally, and emotionally. The past three years have been punctured by constant trauma, and frequent humiliation. The past two weeks have seen him risk arrest, death and starvation to cross a sea and a continent. He is thirsty, hungry, smelly, sleep-deprived, and now a bag of nerves. And every step he walks, he feels a pang from his infected foot.
His journey is one of epic heroism – a kind of latter-day Homeric odyssey. But right now, he just feels miserable and nauseous. His knees wobble from the cold, and from the fear. He clicks his teeth, and paces around the platform until finally two white lights appear in the tunnel in the distance. His ride to Sweden is here. One more train journey to go, one more border to cross.
The train glides east, stopping first at Orestad, then Tarstrup, two areas in east Copenhagen. If the sun was up, Hashem would be able to see Orestad’s eccentric new housing estate, whose balconies jut haphazardly outwards like the quills of a giant porcupine. But it’s dark, and in any case Hashem has only one place on his mind: Sweden. Getting there without being arrested is the difference between finding a short-term sanctuary, and securing a long-term future.
It’s late, but people still hop on and off. Hashem darts his eyes at each of them: for all he knows, anyone could be border police. The train reaches Copenhagen airport, the last before Sweden. Now just the straits of Oresund, and the bridge that spans them, lie between Hashem and the promised land. He presses his hands together, rolling his palms over each other, again and again.
A man sitting two rows away wakes up with a start, and looks in shock at where he’s ended up: a few stops further than he wanted. Hashem barely registers it. He’s thinking of what lies ahead.
The train enters the bridge. Outside, it’s pitch-black, so he may as well still be in a tunnel. Only the lights of the distant Swedish shoreline reveal that Hashem is about to cross the fifth and final border of his fortnight-long ordeal. Across the world, this bridge became famous as the inspiration for The Bridge, a police procedural about a body found spreadeagled on the line that marks the boundary between Denmark and Sweden. Hashem hopes nothing as dramatic will happen tonight.
The lights of Sweden draw closer and closer, until at last his window draws level with them. He’s crossed into Sweden. The train slows, passing lamp-post after lamp-post until it eases into the Hyllie, the first station on Swedish soil. The change is almost imperceptible: only the lettering on the signage (the Danish Ø has turned into a Swedish Ö) indicates he’s in a new country.
Will there be one final surprise? Hashem looks from the window for a policeman to appear on the empty platform, and foil him at the last. But no one gets on. Not one passenger. The doors clunk shut, and onwards they roll.
Has Hashem done it? He can’t quite believe it, and he needs to double-check before he celebrates. “Are we, he whispers, too scared to say the words out loud, “in Sweden?”
He gets the all-clear, and a grin breaks out across his face for the first time in days. He gives a thumbs-up, first tentatively, and then emphatically. He scratches his right ear, letting the realisation sink in. It’s 2:41am, 22 April 2015, and he has reached the place he hopes to call home for the rest of his life. Hashem shuts his eyes, and raises his eye-brows. And then lets out a long lungful of breath.
In Malmo, the first major city in Sweden, he calls Hayam, far-away in Egypt. “Hello,” he says. “I’ve arrived.”
It’s too soon to take in what he’s just achieved, and he has yet to officially claim asylum. That can wait till tomorrow. For now, he’ll take another train north to his brother-in-law’s house. There, he’ll wash, sleep, clean his foot, and reflect on a job almost done.
“When I was in Egypt,” smiles Hashem, just as the sun begins to rise, “I said that if I sank I would just be losing one person. But if I succeeded I’d be offering the chance of success to three people – my kids, Osama, Mohamed and Milad. Well, thank god, I secured a beautiful future for them.”
He gets on this final train just moments before it departs. As it pulls out of the station, Hashem is still searching for his seat, just as he still searches for his place in the world. At least now, as the train disappears into a glistening new dawn, he’s in the right carriage.
